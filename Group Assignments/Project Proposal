**Project Proposal**
Capture dometic migration trend in the New York metropolitan region in relation to the great transportation infra neetwork and its effects in local economy, affordability and job market.

**An explanation of why it is important to you, why it matters to others, and what is at stake**
The recent trend of population decline in primary cities and suburban population growth in American Snow belt (Northeast and Mid-West), and the expansive bus, train, and ferry services in "transit desert" (where residents need to walk at least 15 minutes to the nearest subway/rail/ferry station) led us to consider the possible relationship between the two. Despite expansive train/subway/ferry networks, the New York City and its neighboring boroughs, many neighborhoods are still considered not as accessible. However, due to the increasing housing price in Manhattan and job growth in Manhattan's neighboring boroughs, the city population slowly migrates to the "transit desert" neighborhoods. The rezoning of the neighboring boroughs that allows higher density in early 2000s filled up the land near the train tracks first, job growth and demand for affordable housing continue to push development outwards.

Our Interests: transportation and regional economics
Covid caused migration from urban core to suburbs--- we hope to capture this trend, predict the future trend if possible; 

**A description of the spatial scope (e.g. Boyle Heights or Hong Kong), and why space and/or time matters for your project**
We'd love to work on New York regional metropolitan region, big scale, and the most extensive transportation system in the U.S.. 
We'd love to focus on longer time period (5-10 years)

A preliminary but definitive description of data sources (at least two) that you will use
Base map of counties
New York metropolitan regional rail line map and station map 
Population migration based on county--census
Economy - dept of commerce
Housing affordability
Employment

Include datasource with links

**A scope that explains the intended analysis and resulting visualizations for your project**
In this project, we hope to map out the population migration from city center to the "transit desert" in remote areas in Greater New York region, and how such shift expands the city boundary, from an island to slowly incorporating surrounding regions into its economic development. We hope to showcase the impacts of suburbanization on city center and previous "transit desert" areas, in terms of land use and housing costs (Feel free to delete this...not sure at this point if we are committed to so many topics)
We'd love to develop a map shows transit stations (train/subway/ferry) in neighborhoods/regions that are considered as "transit desert", and population shift trend in those areas and in New York City. 

**A concluding paragraph of what insights you expect to gain from your research**
We hope to understand to incorporate data of economic, population and housing to population migration in New York metropolitan areas. In addition, we hope to gain coding and research skills during our research project, we also hope to understand to transform data into a visual communication tool.
